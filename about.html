        <h4> About Me </h4> <br>
        <p> I graduated from the University of Virginia in 2016 with a degree in Economics. What I enjoyed most was learning about elegant approaches to using data to tell compelling stories. </p> <br>
        <p> A great story obviously doesn't need data to be meaningful. As a big film fan, I don't need to think very hard to come up with examples. But a good story with data? That's the best way to influence people. </p> <br>
        <p> It even happened to me when I started to keep track where my time went during the day. No big shocker: I spend a lot of time on my computer. </p> <br>
        <p> However, that insight led me to discover my passion for learning about elegant approaches to building beautiful web applications. I'm looking forward to telling some compelling stories of my own. Cheers! </p> <br> <br>
        <p> <a href="contact.html"> Contact Me </a> with potential projects, cool data visualizations, or to talk about the lastest Linklater movie. It'll be fun. </p>
