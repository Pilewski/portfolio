        <h4> About Me </h4> <br>
        <p> I graduated from the University of Virginia in 2016 with a degree in Economics. What I enjoyed learning about most was how elegant approaches to using data can be used to tell compelling stories.  </p> <br>
        <p> A great story obviously doesn't need data to be meaningful, but a great story <em> with </em> data can change people. </p> <br>
        <p> It happened to me. I started observing my behaviors a little closer in an effort to lead a more deliberate life. It didn't take long for me to make the stunning insight that I spent a lot of time on the internet... </p> <br>
        <p> So before long I decided I had to learn about the elegant approaches to creating it! I'm looking forward to telling some compelling stories of my own. </p> <br> <br>
        <p> <a href="contact.html"> Contact Me </a> with potential projects, interesting data visualizations, or anything else. It'll be fun. </p>
